# IoTColdStorage

This is a Industrial project of IoT domain completed under the guidance of industry experts from V. S Informatics private limited

Food import and export industries face challenges in maintaining the quality and lifespan of bananas due to rapid microbial growth during power outages, leading to significant spoilage. To address this, we propose a microcontroller- based IoT system that monitors the storage environment and remotely controls the release of ethylene gas, ensuring optimal conditions and reducing losses.

The actual problem received is for storing bananas. The issue is that after power cuts off, there is rapid growth of bacteria's and microorganism due to which bananas get rotten which result in huge loss. They want a system which can help in monitoring of storage environment which can be remotely controlled. The system must be able to release the specific amount of ethylene gas for specific amount of time.
So we are providing a solution by designing a system using microcontroller, different kind of loT components, sensors and web technology. The system will be able to monitor and analyze environment and it will release ethylene gas. The user can remotely set the time and amount of gas.

To develop this system, we are using various IoT components and Web Development technologies to provide remote access to client. 
The Various IoT components used are:
1. NodeMCU microcontroller to control devices using programming done by Embedded C language. 
2. DHT 11 Sensor to sense temperature and humidity of chambers. 
3. MQ3 Gas Sensor to sense level of gas. 
4. SMPS, Relays, etc
For Web Development:
1. HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP to develop interactive Web pages
2. 000webhost.com to host our website
3. Thingspeak.com for analytics and graph project and to store data of Sensors
